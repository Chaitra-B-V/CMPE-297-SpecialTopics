Assignment 1 

Do data science (ideally deep learning but simpler one is fine)  using chatgpt code interpreter by picking a popular data set in kaggle website, upload and do various modules of data science

Assignemt 2

Implemented the below three deep learning models using Github Copilot Chat

MNIST dataset Classification 
Text Sentiment Analysis on IMDB reviews dataset 
Image Classification for MNIST_fashion dataset 
The prompts that I have used are as below

• Write a deep neural network in keras to classify MNIST dataset. Also take some example inputs and show results

• Implement a deep learning model for Text Sentiment Analysis with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for IMDB movie reviews

• Build a deep learning model for Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the MNIST FASHION dataset

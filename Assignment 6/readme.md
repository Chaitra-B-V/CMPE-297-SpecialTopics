a) For this question, I have built an end2end generative AI based app using Vue, Vite, Vercel and Replit
I have used a template based on Vue and modified it for my usecase.

I have deployed the application using Vercel.

I have created a generative AI application using Open AI GPT. This application used GPT to answer the questions that the users have. The user first has to input their open AI api key. Then the users can ask any questions they have, and the response is given by Open AI GPT, which is rendered on the application screen.
